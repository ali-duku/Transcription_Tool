The header row spans the entire table horizontally, and beneath it the rows are organized in horizontal bands separated by purple grid lines. In the right-hand section, four lakes are listed vertically one below the other, each occupying its own row with corresponding cells extending leftward across the columns for continent, area, and average depth. In the left-hand section, three lakes are listed vertically, aligned row by row with the first three rows of the right-hand section, while the fourth row on the left side remains empty except for the continuation of the right-hand section's final lake entry. The table is structured symmetrically with consistent column widths and evenly spaced grid lines, and all text appears centered within each cell, forming a clear, organized comparison layout across the two side-by-side sections.](0)\n| البحيرة   | القارة | المساحة/كم² | متوسط العمق/متر | \n|:-----------:|:--------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:| \n| بايكال    |        | 31700        | 740             | \n| سوبيريور  |        | 82000     | 147             | \n| فيكتوريا  |        | 69000       | 40               |\n| هورن      |        | 60000      | 59                |     \n|ميتشجين    |        | 58000     | 85                |\n|إيري      |        | 25000         | 19                |\n| أونتاريو  |        | 19000       | 86                |\n\n![The image consists of two visual sections placed side by side within a rectangular frame bordered in red. On the left side, a series of nested, stepped square outlines are arranged concentrically from the smallest at the lower left to the largest extending toward the upper right, each outlined in a distinct color and labeled with a numerical value along its top horizontal edge representing the side length of the square; the smallest square is outlined in dark yellow and labeled $137.8$, the next larger square is outlined in green and labeled $158.1$, followed by a slightly larger light yellow outline labeled $178.4$, then a red-outlined square labeled $240.8$, above it a dark brown–outlined square labeled $244.95$, then a blue-outlined square labeled $262.6$, and finally the largest outer square outlined in light pink and labeled $286.35$. The horizontal axis at the bottom is marked in green with evenly spaced tick labels $100$, $130$, $160$, $190$, $220$, $250$, $280$, and $310$, followed by the unit km, while the vertical axis on the left side mirrors the same green scale starts from $100$, $130$, $160$, $190$, $220$, $250$, $280$, and $310$ at the top, also followed by km, and above the nested shapes appears the green title \"Area.\" On the right side of the image, a large pale downward-pointing arrow fills the background, inside which a vertical axis labeled at the top in green as \"Average depth in meters\" rises from $30$ at the bottom to $750$ at the top, with intermediate markings at $60$, $90$, $120$, $150$, $300$, $450$, and $600$, and a visible break symbol on the axis between $150$ and $300$, shown as two short blue diagonal slashes across the axis; at the base of this vertical axis there are seven vertical bars rising to different heights, arranged side by side, colored green reaching about 30, dark blue reaching about 50,  dark brown reaching about 60, red reaching about 80, dark yellow reaching about 85, pink reaching about 140, and light yellow reaching about 700 from left to right, with the yellow bar being the tallest and extending close to the upper part of the scale, the pink bar reaching a mid-to-high level below the break, and the remaining bars increasing gradually in height from the shorter green and dark blue bars toward the taller red and light green ones, all visually corresponding in color to the rectangular outlines on the left and reinforcing the comparison between horizontal area measurements in kilometers and vertical depth measurements in meters within the same framed composition.](1)",
